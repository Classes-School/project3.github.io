        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <img src="images/bloomberg.jpeg" alt="Picture of Bloomberg" />
        <p>
          Bloomberg was born on February 14, 1942, at St. Elizabeth's Hospital,
          in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, to William Henry Bloomberg
          (1906-1963), a bookkeeper for a dairy company,[5] and Charlotte (née
          Rubens) Bloomberg (1909-2011).[6][7] The Bloomberg Center at the
          Harvard Business School was named in William Henry's honor.[8][9]
          Bloomberg's family is Jewish,[10] and he is a member of the Temple
          Emanu-El in Manhattan.[11] Bloomberg's paternal grandfather, Rabbi
          Alexander "Elick" Bloomberg, was a Polish Jew.[12][13] Bloomberg's
          maternal grandfather, Max Rubens, was a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant
          from present-day Belarus,[14][15] and his maternal grandmother was
          born in New York to Lithuanian Jewish parents.[16]
        </p>

        <p>
          The family lived in Allston until Bloomberg was two years old,
          followed by Brookline, Massachusetts, for two years, finally settling
          in the Boston suburb of Medford, Massachusetts, where he lived until
          after he graduated from college.[17]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg became an Eagle Scout when he was twelve years
          old.[18][19][20] He graduated from Medford High School in 1960.[21] He
          went on to attend Johns Hopkins University, where he joined the
          fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. While there, he constructed the blue jay
          costume for the university's mascot.[22][23] He graduated in 1964 with
          a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.[24] In 1966,
          he graduated from Harvard Business School with a Master of Business
          Administration (MBA) degree.[25][26][27]
        </p>

      <section class="business">
        <h2>Business Career</h2>
        <p>
          In 1966, Bloomberg was hired for a job earning $9,000 per year[31] at
          Salomon Brothers, a large Wall Street investment bank.[32] Salomon
          Brothers later promoted him to the equities desk.[31] Bloomberg became
          a general partner at Salomon Brothers in 1972; he headed equity
          trading and, later, systems development.[32] Phibro Corporation bought
          Salomon Brothers in 1981, and the new management fired Bloomberg,
          paying him $10 million for his equity in the firm.[33][34][35]
        </p>

        <p>
          Using the money he received from Phibro, Bloomberg—having designed
          in-house computerized financial systems for Salomon—set up a data
          services company named Innovative Market Systems (IMS)[36] based on
          his belief that Wall Street would pay a premium for high-quality
          business information, delivered instantaneously on computer terminals
          in a variety of usable formats.[37] The company sold customized
          computer terminals that delivered real-time market data, financial
          calculations and other analytics to Wall Street firms. The terminal,
          first called <strong>the Market Master terminal</strong>, was released
          to market in December 1982.[38]
        </p>
        <img src="images/terminal.jpg" alt="Bloomberg Terminal" />

        <p>
          In 1986, IMS renamed itself Bloomberg L.P.[32] Over the years,
          ancillary products including Bloomberg News, Bloomberg Radio,
          Bloomberg Message, and Bloomberg Tradebook were launched.[39]
          Bloomberg, L.P. had revenues of approximately $10 billion in 2018.[36]
          As of 2019, the company has more than 325,000 terminal subscribers
          worldwide and employs 20,000 people in dozens of locations.[36]

      <section class="wealth">
        <h2>Wealth</h2>
        <p>
          In March 2009, Forbes reported Bloomberg's wealth at $16 billion, a
          gain of $4.5 billion over the previous year, the world's biggest
          increase in wealth from 2008 to 2009.[52] Bloomberg moved from 142nd
          to 17th in the Forbes list of the world's billionaires in only two
          years.[53][54] In the 2019 Forbes list of the world's billionaires, he
          was the ninth-richest person; his net worth was estimated at $55.5
          billion.[55] Currently, Bloomberg's net worth is estimated at
          <em>$94.5 billion</em>, ranking him 7th on Forbes' list of
          billionaires.[56]
        </p>

        <p>
          The culture of the company in the 1980s and 1990s has been compared to
          a <em>fraternity</em>, with employees bragging in the company's office
          about their sexual exploits.[40][41] The company was sued four times
          by female employees for sexual harassment, including one incident in
          which a victim claimed to have been raped.[42][43] To celebrate
          Bloomberg's 48th birthday, colleagues published a pamphlet entitled
          Portable Bloomberg: The Wit and Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg. Among
          various sayings that were attributed to him, several have subsequently
          been criticized as sexist or misogynistic.[44]
        </p>

        <p>
          When he left the position of CEO to pursue a political career as the
          mayor of New York City, Bloomberg was replaced by Lex Fenwick[46][47]
          and later by Daniel L. Doctoroff, after his initial service as deputy
          mayor under Bloomberg.[48] After completing his final term as the
          mayor of New York City, Bloomberg spent his first eight months out of
          office as a full-time philanthropist. In fall 2014, he announced that
          he would return to Bloomberg L.P. as CEO at the end of 2014,[49]
          succeeding Doctoroff, who had led the company since February
          2008.[49][50][51] Bloomberg resigned as CEO of Bloomberg L.P. to run
          for president in 2019.[36]

      <section class="politics">
        <h2>Political Career</h2>
        <h3>Mayor of New York City</h3>
        <p>
          Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th mayor of New York City on
          January 1, 2002.[57] He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009.[58]
          As mayor, he initially struggled with approval ratings as low as 24
          percent;[59] however, he subsequently developed and maintained high
          approval ratings.[60] Bloomberg joined Rudy Giuliani, John Lindsay,
          and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly
          Democratic city.[61]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg stated that he wanted public education reform to be the
          legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of
          his second.[62] Bloomberg chose to apply a statistical, metrics-based
          management approach to city government, and granted departmental
          commissioners' broad autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with
          190 years of tradition, he implemented what New York Times political
          reporter Adam Nagourney called a "bullpen" open office plan, similar
          to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and
          managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is
          intended to promote accountability and accessibility.[63] Bloomberg
          accepted a remuneration of $1 annually in lieu of the mayoral
          salary.[64]
        </p>

        <p>
          As mayor, Bloomberg turned the city's $6 billion budget deficit into a
          $3 billion surplus, largely by raising property taxes.[65] Bloomberg
          increased city funding for the new development of affordable housing
          through a plan that created and preserved an estimated 160,000
          affordable homes in the city.[66][67] In 2003, he implemented a
          successful smoking ban in all indoor workplaces, including bars and
          restaurants, and many other cities and states followed suit.[68] On
          December 5, 2006, New York City became the first city in the United
          States to ban trans-fat from all restaurants.[69] This went into
          effect in July 2008 and has since been adopted in many other cities
          and countries. Bloomberg created bicycle lanes, required chain
          restaurants to post calorie counts, and pedestrianized much of Times
          Square. In 2011, Bloomberg launched the NYC Young Men's Initiative, a
          $127 million initiative to support programs and policies designed to
          address disparities between young Black and Latino men and their
          peers, and personally donated $30 million to the project.[70] In 2010,
          Bloomberg supported the then-controversial Islamic complex near Ground
          Zero.[71]
        </p>

        <p>
          Under the Bloomberg Administration, the New York City Police
          Department greatly expanded its stop and frisk program, with a sixfold
          increase in documented stops.[72] The policy was challenged in U.S.
          Federal Court, which ruled that the city's implementation of the
          policy violated citizens' rights under the Fourth Amendment of the
          Constitution and encouraged racial profiling.[73][74] Bloomberg's
          administration appealed the ruling; however, his successor, Mayor Bill
          de Blasio, dropped the appeal and allowed the ruling to take
          effect.[75] After the September 11 attacks, with assistance from the
          Central Intelligence Agency, Bloomberg's administration oversaw a
          controversial program that surveilled Muslim communities on the basis
          of their religion, ethnicity, and language.[76] The program was
          discontinued in 2014.[77] In a January 2014 Quinnipiac poll, 64
          percent of voters called Bloomberg's 12 years as mayor "mainly a
          success".[78]
        </p>

        <h3>Mayoral elections</h3>
        <h4>2001 election</h4>
        <p>
          In 2001, New York's Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani, was ineligible for
          re-election due to the city's limit of two consecutive terms.
          Bloomberg, who had been a lifelong member of the Democratic Party,
          decided to run for mayor on the Republican ticket.[79] Voting in the
          primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was
          postponed later that day, due to the September 11 attacks. In the
          rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated Herman Badillo, a former
          Democratic congressman, to become the Republican nominee. After a
          runoff, the Democratic nomination went to New York City Public
          Advocate Mark Green.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bloomberg received Giuliani's endorsement to succeed him in the 2001
          election. He also had a huge campaign spending advantage. Although New
          York City's campaign finance law restricts the total amount of
          contributions that a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use
          public funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these
          restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign,
          outspending Green by a ratio of five to one.[80] In the wake of the
          September 11 attacks, Bloomberg's administration made a successful bid
          to host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The convention drew
          thousands of protesters, among them New Yorkers who despised George W.
          Bush and the Bush administration's pursuit of the Iraq War.[81][82]
        </p>

        <h4>2005 election</h4>
        <p>
          Bloomberg was re-elected mayor in November 2005 by a margin of 20
          percent, the widest margin ever for a Republican mayor of New York
          City.[83] He spent almost $78 million on his campaign, exceeding the
          record of $74 million he spent on the previous election. In late 2004
          or early 2005, Bloomberg gave the Independence Party of New York
          $250,000 to fund a phone bank seeking to recruit volunteers for his
          re-election campaign.[84]
        </p>

        <p>
          Former Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer won the Democratic
          nomination to oppose Bloomberg in the general election. Thomas
          Ognibene sought to run against Bloomberg in the Republican Party's
          primary election.[85] The Bloomberg campaign successfully challenged
          the signatures Ognibene submitted to the Board of Elections to prevent
          Ognibene from appearing on ballots for the Republican primary.[85]
          Instead, Ognibene ran on only the Conservative Party ticket.[86]
          Ognibene accused Bloomberg of betraying Republican Party ideals, a
          feeling echoed by others.[87]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg opposed the confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of
          the United States.[91] Bloomberg is a staunch supporter of abortion
          rights and did not believe that Roberts was committed to maintaining
          Roe v. Wade.[91] In addition to Republican support, Bloomberg obtained
          the endorsements of several prominent Democrats: former Democratic
          mayor Ed Koch; former Democratic governor Hugh Carey; former
          Democratic City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, and his son, Councilman
          Peter Vallone Jr.; former Democratic Congressman Floyd Flake (who had
          previously endorsed Bloomberg in 2001), and Brooklyn Borough President
          Marty Markowitz.[92]
        </p>

        <h4>2009 election</h4>
        <p>
          On October 2, 2008, Bloomberg announced he would seek to extend the
          city's term limits law and run for a third mayoral term in 2009.
          Bloomberg said, "Handling this financial crisis while strengthening
          essential services ... is a challenge I want to take on," Bloomberg
          said at a news conference. "So should the City Council vote to amend
          term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of
          independent leadership and then decide if I have earned another
          term."[93]
        </p>

        <p>
          Ronald Lauder, who campaigned for New York City's term limits in 1993
          and spent over 4 million dollars of his own money to limit the maximum
          years a mayor could serve to eight years,[94] sided with Bloomberg and
          agreed to stay out of future legality issues.[95] In exchange, he was
          promised a seat on an influential city board by Bloomberg.[96]
        </p>

        <p>
          Some people and organizations objected and NYPIRG filed a complaint
          with the City Conflict of Interest Board.[97] On October 23, 2008, the
          city council voted 29-22 in favor of extending the term limit to three
          consecutive four-year terms.[98] After two days of public hearings,
          Bloomberg signed the bill into law on November 3.[99]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg's bid for a third term generated some controversy. Civil
          libertarians such as former New York Civil Liberties Union Director
          Norman Siegel and New York Civil Rights Coalition Executive Director
          Michael Meyers joined with local politicians to protest the process as
          undermining the democratic process.[100]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg's opponent was Democratic and Working Families Party nominee
          Bill Thompson, who had been New York City Comptroller for the past
          eight years and before that, president of the New York City Board of
          Education.[101] Bloomberg defeated Thompson by a vote of 51 percent to
          46 percent.[102] Bloomberg spent $109.2 million on his 2009 campaign,
          outspending Thompson by a margin of more than 11 to one.[103] After
          the release of Independence Party campaign filings in January 2010, it
          was reported that Bloomberg had made two $600,000 contributions from
          his personal account to the Independence Party on October 30 and
          November 2, 2009.[104] The Independence Party then paid $750,000 of
          that money to Republican Party political operative John Haggerty
          Jr.[105]
        </p>

        <p>
          This prompted an investigation beginning in February 2010 by the
          office of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. into
          possible improprieties.[106] The Independence Party later questioned
          how Haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers.[107]
          Former New York State Senator Martin Connor contended that because the
          Bloomberg donations were made to an Independence Party housekeeping
          account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this
          was a violation of campaign finance laws.[108] Haggerty also spent
          money from a separate $200,000 donation from Bloomberg on office
          space.[109]

      <section class="philantropy">
        <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
        <p>
          In August 2010, Bloomberg signed The Giving Pledge, whereby the
          wealthy pledge to give away at least half of their wealth. Since then,
          he has given away $9.5 billion overall including $3.3 billion in 2019.
          According to Chronicle of Philanthropy, he gave away the most money of
          any philanthropist in 2019.[183][184]
        </p>

        <p>
          His Bloomberg Philanthropies foundation focuses on public health, the
          arts, government innovation, the environment, and education.[185][186]
          Through the foundation, he donated or pledged $767 million in
          2018,[187][186][188] and more than $1 billion in 2019.[189]
        </p>

        <p>
          2011 recipients included the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; Centers
          for Disease Control and Prevention; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
          Public Health; World Lung Foundation and the World Health
          Organization. According to The New York Times, Bloomberg was an
          "anonymous donor" to the Carnegie Corporation from 2001 to 2010, with
          gifts ranging from $5 million to $20 million each year.[190] The
          Carnegie Corporation distributed these contributions to hundreds of
          New York City organizations ranging from the Dance Theatre of Harlem
          to Gilda's Club, a non-profit organization that provides support to
          people and families living with cancer. He continues to support the
          arts through his foundation.[191]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg gave $254 million in 2009 to almost 1,400 nonprofit
          organizations,[192] saying, "I am a big believer in giving it all away
          and have always said that the best financial planning ends with
          bouncing the check to the undertaker."[193][194]
        </p>

        <h3>COVID-19 response</h3>
        <p>
          During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, Bloomberg through
          his foundation committed to a wide range of urgent causes including
          researching treatments and vaccines, leading contact tracing to root
          out the virus, supporting the World Health Organization, and funding
          global efforts to fight the spread of the disease and protect
          vulnerable populations. Action included:
        </p>

          Bloomberg is an environmentalist and has advocated policy to fight
          climate change at least since he became the mayor of New York City. At
          the national level, Bloomberg has consistently pushed for
          transitioning the United States' energy mix from fossil fuels to clean
          energy. In July 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies donated $50 million to
          Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, allowing the campaign to expand
          its efforts to shut down coal-fired power plants from 15 states to 45
          states.[206][207] In 2015, Bloomberg announced an additional $30
          million contribution to the Beyond Coal initiative, matched with
          another $30 million by other donors, to help secure the retirement of
          half of America's fleet of coal plants by 2017.[208] In July 2017,
          Europe Beyond Coal was established to phase out use of coal on the
          continent by 2030.[209] Austria closed its final coal-fired plant in
          April 2020.[210] In early June 2019, Bloomberg pledged $500 million to
          reduce climate impacts and shut remaining coal-fired power plants by
          2030 via the new Beyond Carbon initiative.[211][212]
        </p>

        <p>
          Bloomberg Philanthropies awarded a $6 million grant to the
          Environmental Defense Fund in support of strict regulations on
          fracking in the 14 states with the heaviest natural gas
          production.[213] In 2013, Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies
          launched the Risky Business initiative with former Treasury Secretary
          Hank Paulson and hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer. The joint effort
          worked to convince the business community of the need for more
          sustainable energy and development policies, by quantifying and
          publicizing the economic risks the United States faces from the impact
          of climate change.[214] In January 2015, Bloomberg led Bloomberg
          Philanthropies in a $48-million partnership with the Heising-Simons
          family to launch the Clean Energy Initiative. The initiative supports
          state-based solutions aimed at ensuring America has a clean, reliable,
          and affordable energy system.[215]

          2013, he served as the chairman of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership
          Group, a network of the world's biggest cities working together to
          reduce carbon emissions.[216] During his tenure, Bloomberg worked with
          President Bill Clinton to merge C40 with the Clinton Climate
          Initiative, with the goal of amplifying their efforts in the global
          fight against climate change worldwide.[217] He serves as the
          president of the board of C40 Cities.[218] In January 2014, Bloomberg
          began a five-year commitment totaling $53 million through Bloomberg
          Philanthropies to the Vibrant Oceans Initiative. The initiative
          partners Bloomberg Philanthropies with Oceana, Rare, and Encourage
          Capital to help reform fisheries and increase sustainable populations
          worldwide.[219] In 2018, Bloomberg joined Ray Dalio in announcing a
          commitment of $185 million towards protecting the oceans.[220]

          In 2014, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed
          Bloomberg as his first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change to
          help the United Nations work with cities to prevent climate
          change.[221] In September 2014, Bloomberg convened with Ban and global
          leaders at the UN Climate Summit to announce definite action to fight
          climate change in 2015.[222] In 2018, Ban's successor António Guterres
          appointed Bloomberg as UN envoy for climate action.[223][224] He
          resigned in November 2019, in the run-up to his presidential
          campaign.[225] On 5 February 2021, however, he was re-appointed by
          Guterres as his Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions in the
          lead-up to the climate conference in Scotland scheduled for November
          2021.[226]
